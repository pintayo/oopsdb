# OopsDB

**Don't let AI nuke your database.**

Auto-backup and 1-click restore for developers using Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI coding agents.

---

## The Problem

You're vibing. Claude Code is cranking through tasks. Then it decides the fastest way to fix a migration is `DROP TABLE users`. Or it runs `DELETE FROM orders` without a `WHERE` clause. Or it helpfully "cleans up" your SQLite file.

Your data is gone. Your afternoon is gone. Your will to live is negotiable.

## The Fix

```bash
npm install -g oopsdb
oopsdb init      # connect your DB (Supabase, Postgres, MySQL, SQLite)
oopsdb watch     # auto-backup every 5 min
# ... AI nukes your DB ...
oopsdb restore   # pick a snapshot, roll back instantly
```

That's it. Three commands. Your data survives the AI apocalypse.

## What It Does

- **Auto-backups** on a timer (`oopsdb watch`) — set it and forget it
- **Manual snapshots** (`oopsdb snapshot`) — before risky migrations or YOLO prompts
- **Interactive restore** (`oopsdb restore`) — pick any snapshot, roll back in seconds
- **Safety snapshots** — automatically backs up your current state before restoring, so you can't oops your oops
- **Encrypted at rest** — AES-256-CBC encryption on every backup file
- **Zero cloud, zero accounts** — everything stays on your machine
- **Streaming backups** — near-zero memory footprint regardless of DB size

## Supported Databases

| Database | Backup Tool | Restore Tool |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Supabase** | `pg_dump` (with Supabase flags) | `psql` |
| PostgreSQL (Neon, local, other hosted) | `pg_dump` | `psql` |
| MySQL / MariaDB | `mysqldump` | `mysql` |
| SQLite | `sqlite3` | `sqlite3` |

### Supabase (first-class support)

OopsDB has dedicated Supabase support. Just paste your connection string:

```bash
oopsdb init
# → Select "Supabase"
# → Paste your connection string from Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database
# → Done. SSL and Supabase-specific pg_dump flags are handled automatically.
```

Supabase-specific flags applied automatically: `--no-owner`, `--no-privileges`, `--no-subscriptions`, `sslmode=require`.

## Commands

```
oopsdb init                Set up your database connection
oopsdb watch               Auto-backup every 5 minutes
oopsdb watch -i 1          Auto-backup every 1 minute (paranoid mode)
oopsdb snapshot            One-time manual backup
oopsdb restore             Interactive restore from any snapshot
oopsdb status              View backup history and stats
oopsdb secure              Immutable cloud backups (Coming Soon)
oopsdb activate <key>      Activate a Secure license
oopsdb deactivate          Deactivate your license on this machine
oopsdb license             Show current license status
oopsdb clean               Remove all OopsDB data from project
```

## How It Works

1. `oopsdb init` walks you through connecting your database. Credentials are encrypted and saved locally in `.oopsdb/config.json`.
2. `oopsdb watch` runs the native dump tool (`pg_dump`, `mysqldump`, or `sqlite3 .backup`) at your chosen interval. Output is streamed through AES-256-CBC encryption directly to disk — memory usage stays flat even for large databases.
3. `oopsdb restore` shows your snapshots with timestamps and sizes. Pick one, confirm, and your database is rolled back. It takes a safety snapshot first, so you can always undo the undo.

## Requirements

Your system needs the native database CLI tools:

- **PostgreSQL**: `pg_dump` + `psql`
- **MySQL**: `mysqldump` + `mysql`
- **SQLite**: `sqlite3`

OopsDB checks for these on `init` and gives install instructions if they're missing.

## Security

- Credentials encrypted at rest (AES-256-CBC, machine-local key)
- Backup files encrypted at rest (AES-256-CBC, streaming encryption)
- Nothing leaves your machine — no cloud, no telemetry, no accounts
- Add `.oopsdb/` to `.gitignore` (already in ours)

## Pricing

**Free** — Everything local. All databases, unlimited snapshots, encrypted backups. No limits, no accounts, no strings attached.

**Secure** ($9/mo) — Immutable cloud backups that even a rogue AI can't delete. Local backups are great until the AI decides to `rm -rf .oopsdb/`. `oopsdb secure` pushes encrypted snapshots to tamper-proof cloud storage with write-once retention policies. Even if your entire machine gets wiped, your backups survive.
